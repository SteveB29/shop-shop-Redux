# Shop-shop-Redux
- React shopping app with Redux managing global state and Stripe integration for checkout
- App cloned from the [shop-shop](https://github.com/SteveB29/shop-shop) repo which was built following Uconn's coding bootcamp
- This app is refactored to use Redux as it's global state instead of Context API
- Utilizes Redux's <Provider> to make the store accessable to all nested components
- Uses useDispatch to dispatch all state updates to the store
- Uses useSelector to subscribe to state data
